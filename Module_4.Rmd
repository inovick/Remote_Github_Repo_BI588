## Challenges: I haven't been able to push to github, I have to go to git and upload files manually? I had this problem at the end of Sarah's class last semester, where I wasn't able to push. Maybe I have to make a new ID and start over from the beginning? I will see by the end of this module!! One more time!! Ok I got it this time! Had to use the SSH Key

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Module 4 starts here
# Installing stringr, using random-people.csv file, installed vioplot to get stringr because it said it wasn't found

```{r}
install.packages("stringr")
getwd()
installed.packages()
install.packages("vioplot")


```

## First problem of module 4 using matrices
```{r}
m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
m
m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE)
m
m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
m
v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
v2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9)
m1 <- rbind(v1, v2)
m1
m2 <- cbind(v1, v2)
m2
```
## Extracting metadata about matrices and using array
```{r}
class(m1)
dim(m1)
class(m2)
dim(m2)
colnames(m2)
rownames(m2)
str(m2)
a <- array(data = 1:90, dim = c(5, 6, 3))
a
```
## Subsetting
```{r}
v <- 1:100
v
v[1:15]
v[c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)]
v <- 101:200
v[seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 2)]
m <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)
m
x <- m[4, 5]
x
```

## Challenge 1: Ulysses Vector
```{r}
 s <- c("Stately", "plump", "Buck", "Mulligan", "came", "from", "the", "stairhead,", "bearing", "a", "bowl", "of", "lather", "on", "which", "a", "mirror", "and", "a", "razor", "lay", "crossed”)
 
 stringr()


```

## Challenge 2: Matrix
```{r}
```

## Challenge 3: 400 Element Array
```{r}
```

## Overwriting
```{r}
m[7, 1] <- 564
m[, 8] <- 2
m[2:5, 4:8] <- 1
m[2:5, 4:8] <- c(20, 19, 18, 17)
m[2:5, 4:8] <- matrix(data = c(20:1), nrow = 4, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
m[, 8] <- c("a", "b")
```
## Lists and dataframes
```{r}
s <- c("this" "is" "a" "vector" "of" "strings")  # here we have a vector
m <- matrix(data = 1:40, nrow = 5, ncol = 8)  # this is a matrix
b <- FALSE  #and this is a logical statement
l <- list(s, m, b)  # this puts them all together as a list
l
l[[2]]
l[[2]][2, 6]
l[1:2]
```
